## Core Components

1. **Bot:** The conversational interface that interacts with users.
2. **Intent:** Represents an action the user wants to perform (e.g., booking a flight).
3. **Slot:** Parameters required to fulfill an intent (e.g., destination, date).
4. **Fulfillment:** The backend logic executed to complete the intent (often via AWS Lambda).
5. **Locale:** Defines the language and region for the bot's interactions.

2. **Define Intents:** Specify the actions the bot should recognize and handle.
3. **Set Up Slots:** Identify the information needed to fulfill each intent.
4. **Configure Fulfillment:** Link the bot to backend services or AWS Lambda functions.
5. **Test and Publish:** Use the built-in test window to simulate conversations and refine the bot before deployment.
