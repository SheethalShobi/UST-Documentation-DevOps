An IAM role is a set of permissions that can be assumed by a service (like EC2, Lambda, etc.) or a user.
Roles are used to delegate access without using long-term credentials like access keys.

For example:
An EC2 instance might need to access S3 buckets, so you assign it a role with AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess.

How to Create an IAM Role
🔹 Step 1: Go to IAM Console and Click Create role

🔹 Step 2: Choose Trusted Entity - Choose AWS service
  Choose a use case: e.g., EC2

🔹 Step 3: Attach Permissions Policies
Select policies to define what the role can do. 
For example: AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess – allows read access to S3
            CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy – for EC2 monitoring
            AmazonEC2FullAccess – (⚠️ not recommended unless needed)

🔹 Step 4: Name the Role
Name your role something clear like: EC2-S3AccessRole
(Optional) Add a description or tags
Click Create role

🔹 Step 5: Attach Role to EC2 Instance
Go to EC2 Console
Click Instances
Select your instance
Click Actions > Security > Modify IAM Role
Choose the role you just created
Click Update IAM role
