## üîç Key Differences: LLM Deployment vs Normal Deployment

| Aspect | Normal Web/App Deployment | LLM Deployment |
|--------|----------------------------|----------------|
| **Compute Requirements** | CPU or small EC2 instances (e.g., t2.micro, t3.medium) | High-end GPU instances (e.g., `g5`, `p4d`, `p5`) |
| **Memory (RAM)** | 1‚Äì8 GB RAM is usually enough | 40 GB+ RAM needed (LLMs are huge!) |
| **Model Size** | <100 MB (typical ML models) | 5 GB ‚Äì 200+ GB (LLaMA, Falcon, GPT-J, etc.) |
| **Latency Sensitivity** | Lower importance | Low-latency critical (users expect quick replies) |
| **Storage Requirements** | Mostly for DB and logs | S3/FSx needed to store large model binaries |
| **Scaling** | Auto scaling of stateless apps | GPU autoscaling is complex and expensive |
| **Deployment Platform** | ECS, EC2, Lambda, or EKS | Mostly EC2 with GPU, SageMaker, or EKS with GPUs |
| **Inference Framework** | Flask, FastAPI, simple REST apps | TGI, vLLM, DeepSpeed, or custom inference servers |
| **Security** | Focused on API keys, IAM | Data privacy + memory isolation + token safety |
| **Cost** | Low to moderate | Very high ($$$/hour for GPUs) |

## üß† Why LLM Deployment is Different

### 1. Massive GPU Compute
- CPUs cannot efficiently perform transformer-based inference.
- GPU instances (e.g., g5, p4d, p5) are mandatory for real-time LLMs.

### 2. Token-Based Processing
- LLMs use tokenized inputs and outputs.
- Requires frameworks like HuggingFace Transformers, vLLM, TGI.

### 3. Large Model Loading
- LLMs can take minutes to load into memory.
- Fast I/O from S3 or FSx is needed to handle large weights.

### 4. High Memory Usage
- Some models use up to 80 GB VRAM.
- Models often need to be quantized or sharded.

### 5. Inference Optimization Tools
- **vLLM**: Optimized inference engine with PagedAttention.
- **TGI**: Text Generation Inference from HuggingFace.
- **DeepSpeed**: Distributed inference support.

### 6. GPU-aware Autoscaling
- LLMs are stateful and GPU-bound.
- Use Cluster Autoscaler or Karpenter with taints/tolerations in EKS.
